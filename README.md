## 🏗️ Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:

### US Bank Credit Card 💳
With 1+ years of experience in data ingestion, curation, wrangling, cleaning, lineage, and analytics/discovery using tools like Python, SQL, Spark, Teradata, and Tableau. In this project, I have worked on data discovery methods for marketing campaigns using descriptive and predictive analytics to identify customer segments, preferences and behavior patterns. Also, creating datasets with traits for customer targeting using machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems. 

### Web Scraping Project for a Job Portal 🏢
I have scraped data from a job portal using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests and cleaned and preprocessed data to get insights and trends such as popular job titles, skills, and job locations. I also visualized the data using Python libraries such as Plotly and Pandas.

### ML Project - Cancer Diagnosis 🩺
I have built a machine learning model to predict whether the breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. I preprocessed data using tools such as Pandas and NumPy, built and evaluated several models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines using Scikit-learn, and fine-tuned the best model using GridSearchCV.
