## 🏗️ Projects
Some of the cool things I have worked on:

### US Bank Credit Card 💳
Data engineer with 1+ years of experience in data ingestion, curation, wrangling, cleaning, lineage, and analytics/discovery using tools such as Python, SQL, Spark, Teradata, and Tableau. 
- 🧐 Worked on projects involving:
    - Data discovery for marketing campaigns using descriptive and predictive analytics to identify customer segments, preferences and behaviour patterns.
    - Creating datasets with traits for customer targeting using machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification and recommendation systems.
    - Setting proactive credit limits with correlation analysis using statistical methods such as linear regression, ANOVA, and hypothesis testing. 

### Web Scraping Project for a Job Portal 🏢 
I scraped data from a job portal using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests. I cleaned and preprocessed data and got insights and trends such as popular job titles, skills, and job locations. I also visualized the data using Python libraries such as Plotly and Pandas

### ML Project - Cancer Diagnosis 🩺 
I built a machine learning model to predict whether the breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. I preprocessed data using tools such as Pandas and NumPy, built and evaluated several models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines using Scikit-learn, and fine-tuned the best model using GridSearchCV.
